# Peak Counter GUI

This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) application for counting peaks in pressure data. It allows users to input parameters for peak detection and visualize the results in an intuitive interface.

```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:phelanhobbs/ALDPeakCounter.git
   cd peak-counter-gui
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

2. Working with the application:
- Add data files using the file selection dialog
- Set peak detection parameters (height, prominence, distance, width)
- Process the files to detect peaks
- Apply offsets to adjust data as needed
- View results in both text format and interactive plots
- Reset offsets if necessary

## Building an Executable

To build a standalone executable:

   ```
   pip install pyinstaller 
   pyinstaller .\peak-counter.spec
   ```
   
The executable will be created in the `dist` directory.

## Testing

To run the unit tests for the peak counting functionality:

   ```
   pytest test_peakCount.py
   ```
